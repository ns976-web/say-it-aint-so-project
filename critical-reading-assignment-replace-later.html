Novara and Stephen Henry discuss the evolution of indie rock from the 1980s to the 2000s. Novara and Henry argue that indie rock began as an underground genre, independent of conventional rock, but it incorporated more elements of popular music to break into the mainstream as time progressed. This argument is important because it displays how while artists are inevitably influenced by commercial incentives, they will still try to stay true to themselves and their sound. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The authors take a chronological approach to their argument, laying out songs of different eras in indie rock in the order in which they came out. The songs they pick are meant by the authors to be representative of their era (Novara &amp; Henry 2009, 817). The purpose of this chronological approach was to establish a causal link between indie rock songs and the songs that released before them, with Novara and Henry writing, “the recordings highlighted in this article are representative of their respective eras and illustrate ways that the ‘anxiety of influence’ may be in play as the artists respond to, build on, challenge, or reject the works of their predecessors” (817). The authors support their choice of songs with both industry publications like </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pitchfork and All Music Guide</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as well as academic music literature (817). </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Novara and Henry write that in the 1980s, small bands started experimenting with music in ways that diverged noticeably from the mainstream (819). One group they mention is Dinosaur Jr. This band challenged the masculine energy of hard rock by overlaying their guitar parts with sensitive lyrics on </span><i></i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjOVICqIpjQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’re Living All Over Me</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (1987)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They also took unorthodox approaches to song structure, having lyrics in typically instrumental places and instrumentals in typically lyrical places (820). The authors go on to say that in the period of time in the 1990s before the release of Nirvana’s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOn1ABbJKiw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nevermind</a></span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, indie rock was doing very well financially, as independent record labels were proving to be a beneficial choice for artists (822). Subgenres such as alt.country and math rock were able to develop and thrive (822-823). One moment that Novara and Henry highlight is the release of Superchunk’s </span><i></i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA95460887C831CDC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">No Pocky for Kitty</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (1991)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They refer to it as a “defining moment in indie rock history” because Superchunk decided against working with major labels, choosing the independent Matador label instead (823). The album proceeded to perform well critically and financially, showing that indie rock had grown enough to subsist without major record labels (824).</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Novara and Henry argue that the release of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevermind</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (1991) by Nirvana was a pivotal moment in indie rock, as they were able to find the right balance of grunge rock and pop elements such that the album was much more accessible (824). Due to the success of the album, record labels started looking for other indie groups to sign (824). The authors argue that even though it would have been very easy for these artists to just make the music that would get them signed, they instead stuck to their musical aesthetic (825). They give Pavement’s </span><i></i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMxy067kbpQhEUHEuGsZNv3zJW0XBpcTM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slanted and Enchanted </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(1992)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as an example, as it had an “amateuristic flavor” that made it unique (825). Going into the late 1990s and early 2000s, the authors say that indie rock branched out into further subgenres and found greater commercial success due to more acceptance by the public (827-829). </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The author’s argument is relevant because it shows how music is influenced by both commercial desires and the artists’ authenticity. Music is an industry, meaning artists will of course be thinking about making money with their art. That will always be a driving force in their sound. However, this does not prevent them from staying authentic in their sound. Like Pavement, indie rock artists would generally keep their aesthetic alive in their music. Even though they may have incorporated elements from popular rock, that does not mean they abandoned their original sound altogether. This is further supported by the Superchunk example, as the band stuck with an independent record label, which likely gave them more freedom in their music. This meant they would not have to sacrifice their key aesthetic, but they could still remain popular due to the inclusion of popular elements. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Novara and Henry clearly spent a great deal of effort selecting their representative songs. They narrow down entire eras of indie rock into just four or five songs. For the most part, they did this effectively, as the chosen songs adequately supported their intended argument. Furthermore, having academic music literature to back up their song choices lends them greater credibility in said choices. However, I think there were certain points in the article where their song choices did not make as much sense to me. For example, I felt as though the examples given to represent the pre-Nevermind era in the 1990s were a bit disconnected from each other. They did not seem to be conveying a clear message that was especially different from that of the 1980s era. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The authors’ argument could have been made stronger if they took more nuanced positions. Novara and Henry mainly focus on the songs that support the argument they are making, so the evidence seems a little cherry-picked. By including a song that might not have fit their argument exactly, but then rebutting it, perhaps they could avoid this issue. They even address this issue themselves, saying that “some amount of subjectivity in the selections is unavoidable” (817). Had they included opposing viewpoints, then the subjectivity would not have been as much of an issue. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In conclusion, Novara and Henry explain how indie rock changed from the 1980s to the 2000s, giving specific examples of songs to represent certain eras. While some of their choices felt disconnected and unnuanced, they still managed to sum up eras of music with a small selection of songs. Their argument was that the genre was at first propped up by smaller bands, but over time it became more accessible to the broader public as it included more popular elements. Their argument is significant because it shows that artists can make decisions for the sake of success and popularity while still being honest with themselves and their original aesthetic.</span></p><p><a href="https://ns976-web.github.io/say-it-aint-so-project/music-review-replace-later.html">Masculinity and Identity in "Say It Ain't So"</a></p><p><a href="https://ns976-web.github.io/say-it-aint-so-project/bibliography.html">Bibliography</a></p><p> </p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><nav class="footer__nav"><ul></ul></nav><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://ns976-web.github.io/say-it-aint-so-project/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://ns976-web.github.io/say-it-aint-so-project/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
