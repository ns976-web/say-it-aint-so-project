Contrasting with the popular depiction of rockers with cool shirts and ripped jeans, the members of Weezer opt for more sensible collared shirts, khaki pants, and glasses. Generally, they are best described as nerdy, and this feeling is present in their music as well. Their sound is very anxious, almost uncomfortable:</span></p><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="405" height="228" style="width: 405px; height: 228px;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OoPHItnUFkw?si=rjGOLeCRyeiABh2Q&amp;clip=UgkxkOoF8hTNf9Hih34-KOmByvIoZH6i7qLx&amp;clipt=EPiwAxixmQQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite their unusual aesthetic, Weezer was still commercially successful, going “double platinum within 15 months of [their first album’s] release” (Mapes 2017). Weezer was still able to succeed with their nerdy presentation because it made their music more relatable to listeners. Additionally, Weezer was able to take advantage of the privileges of being white in the music industry, as they could take risks with their image and fit in better with geek culture.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As mentioned, the members of Weezer do not at all fit the typical image of a rock star. However, neither do many of the people who listen to alternative rock music, so they might not be able to connect to rock artists who do fit the archetypal rock star. In fact, Weezer’s less conventional presentation may be more relatable to the average listener, as Michael Hann says in his review of <em>The Blue Album;</em> “[lead singer Rivers] Cuomo had a fantastic ear for melody, and a goofish, nerdy uncertainty that made his misery seem universal, in a way that–for all his seismic cultural impact–[Nirvana’s lead singer Kurt] Cobain’s perhaps didn’t” (2019). He continues to say that “Cuomo’s pop culture references, too, were ones that would appeal across swathes” (Hann 2019). Hann makes the argument that Weezer’s nerdiness lent them their ability to resonate with audiences. This is corroborated by Isaac Kuhlman's review of <em>The Blue Album</em>: "</span>This relatability was pivotal in forming a scene that championed authenticity, inclusivity, and the empowerment of 'the uncool,' laying a foundation that still influences modern alternative rock" (2024). <span style="font-weight: 400;">This means that the band strayed away from what was tried and tested and this helped them in their success. Weezer’s nerdiness worked because it allowed the band to connect better with their audiences. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Weezer’s success can also be examined through the lens of race. Indie rock is a predominantly white space of artists (Bannister 2006, 77). A natural consequence of this is that white musicians have an inherent advantage in being accepted by audiences over musicians of other races. This allows them to take risks that diverge from what is the norm, while still being taken seriously in the field. As journalist Sarah Sahim writes in her <em>Pitchfork</em> column, “In indie rock, white is the norm…. White art is deemed more worthy of respect, and so white audiences respond to it positively—it is set up for success” (2015). This idea that white artists are “set up for success” is an important concept with the implication that these artists are given much more agency in their indie endeavours. White musicians have more freedom to express themselves however they like, something that is not afforded to artists of racial minorities. Weezer, as a band of white men, can clearly take advantage of this privilege. They are able to express their nerdiness in their music and style, while still being granted the respect that any other white artist would. This respect meant that Weezer could succeed with an unconventional image, as they were given more freedom to experiment due to their race. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only did Weezer benefit in the indie rock sphere due to being white–they also benefited in the nerd sphere due to being white as well as male. The geek community places much of their identity on being mistreated or looked down upon socially in the past. As a result, they have a “nostalgia” of sorts regarding their previous marginalization (Ottemo et al. 2024). One specific type of nostalgia, restorative nostalgia, seems to be the reason for perpetuating racial and gendered dominance in geek culture. Restorative nostalgia is an aggressive desire to return to past traditions. This can lead to people thinking that updates to any part of their community are inherently improper, and that the previous ways were more true. In the geek community, this can mean, for example, being against changes to the racial or gender composition of certain movies. Ottemo et al. mentions the “misogyny and racism that faced Kelly Marie Tran, the first Asian-American actress cast in a lead role in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Star Wars</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">” (2024). The original </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Star Wars</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> films had mostly white actors, and changing this in the newer movies led to backlash from fans of the franchise</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Essentially, geek culture severely limits those who are not white males because of the restorative nostalgia that is present in the community. Because Weezer is a band of white men, they are not subject to this disadvantage, so they can thrive in the geek community as they match the typical demographic. Thus, they could be accepted by geek culture, allowing them to succeed with their aesthetic. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In conclusion, Weezer stood out against other indie rock bands due to their uncool attire and unassured vocals. Despite this, they were still successful commercially because of the relatability that came with being nerdy. Their risk of not being taken seriously was mitigated because they were white men, which allowed them to succeed in the indie rock and nerd communities.</span></p><p><a href="https://ns976-web.github.io/say-it-aint-so-project/playlist-and-listening-guide-replace-later.html">An Addict's Journey</a></p><p><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);"><a href="https://ns976-web.github.io/say-it-aint-so-project/conclusion.html">Conclusion</a></span></p><p><a href="https://ns976-web.github.io/say-it-aint-so-project/bibliography.html">Bibliography</a></p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><nav class="footer__nav"><ul></ul></nav><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://ns976-web.github.io/say-it-aint-so-project/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://ns976-web.github.io/say-it-aint-so-project/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
