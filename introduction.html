It tells the story of the moment Cuomo opens his fridge and sees a bottle of beer inside, at which point he has flashbacks to his alcoholic father who left his family at a young age. His mind races, thinking his stepfather has also developed similar habits. The song is a vulnerable description of Cuomo’s feelings at this moment. The song was on Weezer’s 1994 eponymous first album</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, also known as </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Blue Album</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which propelled them to fame. The album put Weezer’s nerdiness on full display, with anxious vocals and uncool song topics, contrasting sharply with the edgy, rebellious style that was conventional for alternative rock. Despite this departure from the typical indie rock aesthetic, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Blue Album</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> still did very well, going “double platinum within 15 months of its release” (Mapes 2017). In this project, I argue that “Say It Ain’t So” by Weezer incorporates popular elements of its time, such as the Nirvana-esque grunge sound and more vulnerable masculinity; despite this concession to the mainstream, it still has a nerdy aesthetic that reflects Weezer’s overall identity. This dichotomy is reflective of how indie rock balances the inclusion of artists’ unique styles with what is popular and accessible to the general public. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first page, “Indie Rock’s Dual Influences,” discusses “A Guide to Essential American Indie Rock (1980-2005),” a paper on how indie rock evolved throughout said time period (Novara &amp; Henry 2009). The page explains that one of the main points of this article is how after the release of the Nirvana album </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevermind</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, indie rock became much more successful commercially, as the artists followed Nirvana's lead and fpeobegan to integrate more mainstream sounds into their music. This made the songs more accessible to the average listener, which increased their popularity and moved away from the “exclusivity” appeal of the genre as described by Ryan Hibbett in “What is Indie Rock” (2005). However, even with these changes, most indie rock artists still kept their genuine aesthetic at the core of their sound. There would be something unique to the artist that would differentiate themselves from the mainstream. “Say It Ain’t So” was definitely influenced by this post-</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevermind </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">trend, with Cuomo saying himself that the sound of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Blue Album</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was strongly inspired by The Beach Boys </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pet Sounds</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a mainstream pop rock album (Cuomo 2024). However, the anxoius, unconfident vocals still sound nerdy, which is something that is unique to Weezer. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This dichotomy of both appealing to popular sounds and sticking to one’s own aesthetic is further explored in “Masculinity and Identity in ‘Say It Ain’t So.’” Here, it is argued that the significance of  “Say It Ain’t So” comes from its vulnerable depiction of masculinity, as well as Weezer's nerdy image. While these two points seem unrelated, they actually represent the two sides of the argument of my project. During the time of the release of the song, alternative rock had been moving away from the hypermasculinity that was depicted in the ‘80s, and towards a more emotionally expressive “man” (de Boise 2014). “Say It Ain’t So” follows this shift in portrayal in the genre. This can be seen as Weezer following what is popular, as their music is in line with what was expected from indie musicians at the time. However, they still maintain their geeky appearance and sound. They dress in khakis, button-down shirts, and glasses, more akin to a student than a rock artist. Their music itself sounds very anxious, giving off an unconfident feeling. These elements of their style contribute to the band’s overall nerdiness. Weezer simultaneously following cultural shifts while preserving their identity shows how they can appeal to the mainstream while also staying true to their core aesthetic. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The following two pages, “An Addict’s Journey” and “Nerd Aesthetics and White Privilege in Indie Rock,” flesh out each of these two aspects of “Say It Ain’t So.” The former is a playlist with an accompanying listening guide that provides a whole story built around the emotional display in the song. This journey through the life of a recovered addict takes many emotional turns, one of which occurs with “Say It Ain’t So” as the backdrop. This playlist gives an immersive view of how Weezer utilized the popular depiction of the emotional male in the song. On the other hand, “Nerd Aesthetics and White Privilege in Indie Rock” discusses the significance of Weezer’s nerdiness. The page examines how it fits into the rest of “geek culture,” as the relationship of an artist with their audience can lend information about the song (Behr 2016). These two pages develop the points that "Say It Ain't So" is both follows the trend in indie rock of emotional music, as well as that it still contains Weezer's core aesthetic of nerdiness. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My analysis of Weezer’s “Say It Ain’t So” aims to provide commentary on how indie bands are both impacted by the culture around them, as well as their own ideas of how their music should sound. Overall, the song manages to tie together the mainstream masculine image with Weezer’s own ideas of who they are, a trend that is representative of the post-</span><i style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">Nevermind </i><span style="font-weight: 400;">era of alternative rock. </span></p><p><a href="https://ns976-web.github.io/say-it-aint-so-project/critical-reading-assignment-replace-later.html">Indie Rock's Dual Influences</a></p><p><a href="https://ns976-web.github.io/say-it-aint-so-project/bibliography.html">Bibliography</a></p><p> </p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><nav class="footer__nav"><ul></ul></nav><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://ns976-web.github.io/say-it-aint-so-project/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://ns976-web.github.io/say-it-aint-so-project/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
