You stumble across your living room before making your way to the couch. On the way there, you trip over nothing and fall onto the floor. It should hurt, but you don’t feel much of anything at this point. The only sensation you have is the smell of your own pungent breath. You crawl over to the couch and clumsily hoist yourself onto it. As you begin to sleep, you hear faint footsteps trotting down the stairs. Instantly, you bolt up as fast as you can (which is not that fast). Trying your best to form words, you manage a slurred, “go back to sleep,” and you hear those little footsteps going back up the stairs. As you once shut your eyes, you hear muffled cries coming from upstairs. Even in your current state, you know you have a problem. You once thought you could keep it to yourself, but it’s obvious now that your disease has spread. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Addiction is a problem that destroys lives every day. Once it takes hold, dealing with it is difficult. Anybody could fall victim to it, and it does not just affect them. It affects everyone around them as well, ruining relationships for the addicted person. Many times, people might not even realize that they have a problem. Often, an important relationship in a person’s life can be a wake up call. Weezer’s “Say It Ain’t So” is this wake up call, but from the perspective of the other side: the innocent bystander witnessing the substance abuse. This playlist explores the tumultuous journey of an addict that realizes he has an issue when his child speaks up about it, with that moment represented by “Say It Ain’t So.”</span></p><figure class="post__video"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="314" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_oPU3XXzlvY" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></figure><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blake Shelton sets the tone for the beginning of our odyssey with “The More I Drink,” an upbeat country song. It is about a man who does not drink because he knows if he does, he won’t be able to stop. However, in the second verse, he is handed some beers and begins to let loose. With its bouncy piano riffs and its classic country guitar, “The More I Drink” is a best-case scenario of what might happen after drinking too much. With the story just beginning, our addict has no idea what is in store for him. </span></p><figure class="post__video"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="314" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/27rKrR424cA" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></figure><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we move on to “Mr. Brownstone,” by Guns N’ Roses, our addict is starting to realize he becoming dependent on alcohol. As said in the song, “I used to do a little, but a little wouldn’t do it \ So the little got more and more \ I just keep tryin’ to get a little better \ Said a little better than before.” What used to be enough to satisfy him is no longer enough. Despite this clear issue, the music itself doesn’t really sound depressed in any way. Instead, it sounds energetic, with the beat moving along and the electric guitar adding some flair. Similarly to the previous song, our addict has yet to have his spirit broken. </span></p><figure class="post__video"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="314" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t2TKqJ2FXGM" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></figure><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this point, the people in the addict’s life begin to notice his bad habits. His loved ones try to convince him that he should seek help, but he refuses. This is what Amy Winehouse’s “Rehab” represents. Winehouse sings about her choice not to go to rehab, despite being told she should. She maintains a put-together facade, projecting a cheerful image using a swinging rhythm. However, her lyrics are telling–like when she sings, “I don’t ever wanna drink again \ I just, ooh, I just need a friend.” In the same way, our addict knows deep down that he should get help. Unfortunately, he won’t admit it to those around him, and keeps up the happy exterior we have seen in the previous songs. </span></p><figure class="post__video"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="314" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/E0ozmU9cJDg" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></figure><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our addict is now under the total control of his vice. This dark moment in his life is characterized by “Master of Puppets” by Metallica. In this song, the lyrics are all about being commanded by a “master,” which represents a substance addiction. The aggressive music further drives home how powerful this master is, and how it is nigh impossible to overcome. This tone is very different from what we have seen previously, shifting to a more bleak mood. This is our addict's lowest point of the journey. </span></p><figure class="post__video"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="314" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OoPHItnUFkw" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></figure><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With our addict in the depths of his disease, it is hard to imagine what might pull him out. After all his loved ones begged for him to find help, there was one plea that stood out to him: his child’s. This plea is represented by “Say It Ain’t So” by Weezer, an emotional song about a son who sees a beer in the fridge and worries his stepdad is an addict like his birth father was. The song starts soft, but gets louder in the first chorus. By the second chorus, more instrumentation is added to make it even more powerful. By the time the bridge hits, the song has built up a lot of tension that resolves with a raw “yeah, yeah” and a guitar solo. In the same way, the addict’s child has been getting more and more anxious as our addict has spiraled out of control, and finally, he speaks up. This gets the addict’s attention, and he realizes he needs to fix his issue. </span></p><figure class="post__video"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="314" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RwTwd5tAq1U" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></figure><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our addict decides he needs to take active steps to fight this problem, and he needs to do so now. This sense of importance and urgency is encapsulated in “Breaking the Habit” by Linkin Park. The song establishes a feeling of exigency with the opening staccato high hat rhythm, reminiscent of a clock ticking down. This pattern continues for the rest of the song. Also, the repetition of the phrase “I don’t know” at the start of the first three lines of the chorus exhibits a forward-moving drive. These elements combined together illustrate the feelings of our addict, who has an intense need to break his habits and overcome his addiction. </span></p><figure class="post__video"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="314" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/suK9egRcWm8" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></figure><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After fighting the most difficult battle he has ever experienced, our addict finally gets a moment of emotional catharsis. This feeling is displayed in James Arthur’s “Recovery.” In this stirring song, we hear the music swell during the chorus that corresponds to the strong emotions tied to making it through an addiction. The lyrics also use powerful imagery, saying, “In my recovery \ I’m a soldier at war \ I have broken down walls.” The comparison of a recovering addict to a soldier is a testament to how much work an addict has to put into their rehabilitation. Additionally, the visual of destroying walls is an effective way to represent one’s vanquishing of their struggles. The song also contains a frequent usage of first person pronouns, such as above and in the lines, “I defined, I design \ My recovery.” This puts the focus on the former addict, who beat their addiction through their own effort and dedication. At last, our addict can rest. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You come home now with a pep in your step. You had a great day: your team at work went out for lunch, you got promoted, and you found a dollar on the street. You walk over to the kitchen and grab yourself a can of soda. You sit down by the window and take in the nice, sunny day. You open the window and smell the fresh scent of the flowers in your yard, hear the calm breeze enter gently into your home, feel it lightly kiss your cheeks. This brings a smile to your face, one wider and whiter than ever before. Just then, you hear an excited galloping down the stairs. You turn around, and in front of you is your protector, your savior. On his face is a matching smile.</span></p><p><a href="https://ns976-web.github.io/say-it-aint-so-project/final-essay-replace-later.html">Nerd Aesthetics and White Privilege in Indie Rock</a></p><p><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);"><a href="https://ns976-web.github.io/say-it-aint-so-project/conclusion.html">Conclusion</a></span></p><p><a href="https://ns976-web.github.io/say-it-aint-so-project/bibliography.html">Bibliography</a></p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><nav class="footer__nav"><ul></ul></nav><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://ns976-web.github.io/say-it-aint-so-project/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://ns976-web.github.io/say-it-aint-so-project/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
