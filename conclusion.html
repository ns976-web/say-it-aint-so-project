The trend at the time was producing more raw songs that explore an emotional form of masculinity. "Say It Ain't So" falls under this category of songs, as it depicts the vulnerable moment in Cuomo's life when he believes his stepfather is an alcoholic. Even though Weezer uses this theme that is common to alternative rock in this time period, they still inject the song with core aspects of their identity. Specifically, Weezer's nerdiness shines through in the song, with Cuomo's voice sounding very insecure and anxious. Furthermore, their khaki pants and button-down shirts cement their unconventional style when compared to the ripped jeans and graphic t-shirts common for most bands. Thus, it is clear that "Say It Ain't So" represents how alternative rock artists will make some concessions to what is popular, yet still incorporate their authentic selves in their sound.Â </p><p><a href="https://ns976-web.github.io/say-it-aint-so-project/">Back Home</a></p><p><a href="https://ns976-web.github.io/say-it-aint-so-project/bibliography.html">Bibliography</a></p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><nav class="footer__nav"><ul></ul></nav><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://ns976-web.github.io/say-it-aint-so-project/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://ns976-web.github.io/say-it-aint-so-project/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
