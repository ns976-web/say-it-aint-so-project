The alternative rock song represented a trend in the 1990s of more emotionally raw songs, or “emo” songs (de Boise 2014, 227). The song is about lead singer Rivers Cuomo’s fear of his stepfather beginning an alcohol addiction like Cuomo’s biological father. Despite following the indie norm of emotional music, Weezer was anything but a normal band. They exemplify the "nerd" stereotype, with their awkward attire and insecure vocal quality. “Say It Ain’t So” matters because it is part of the emo-rock movement in which alt-rock artists began to move away from conventional displays of hyper-masculinity, as well as because of Weezer’s success despite their nontraditional image of a group of nerds being in a rock band. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As mentioned earlier, the 1990s was when emo-rock became more prevalent, in contrast to the 1980s when alternative rock posed an extreme version of men, filled with loud power chords and screaming choruses. In the ‘90s, alt-rock bands started having more melodic instrumentals and vocals (de Boise 2014, 227). “Say It Ain’t So” is no exception. The opening guitar riff and the verse are both fairly soft and passive. However, the chorus gains significantly in both volume and urgency, with more prominent instrumentals and desperate vocals:</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Say it ain’t so</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your drug is a heartbreaker</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Say it ain’t so</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My love is a life taker (Weezer 1994).</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In these lines, Cuomo is emotionally pleading for his stepfather not to be an addict, a message that would never be present in alt-rock in the ‘80s. The song further builds up more power in the second chorus, with an added guitar riff, and builds even more in the bridge with very resonant lyrics:</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dear daddy, I write you</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In spite of years of silence</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ve cleaned up, found Jesus</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Things are good, or so I hear</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This bottle of Steven’s awakens ancient feelings</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like father, stepfather</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The son is drowning in the flood</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Weezer 1994).</span></p><figure class="post__video"><video loading="lazy" width="300" height="150" controls="controls" data-mce-fragment="1"><source src="https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxW2-WgPpDXmywIHSIqDHxXaE7t7i0MEa9?si=_k2efQpuF1LYmGMR"></video></figure><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pitchfork’s review of the song describes this bridge perfectly, saying it is “building and building until what's left of Cuomo's vulnerability comes out as a bitterly frayed ‘yeah-yeah,’ all capped by a guitar solo worthy of the Scorpions” (Mapes 2017). Vulnerability is a great word to represent this song; it encapsulates Cuomo’s emotions and how they are presented through the music. It is also something that would not have been able to properly shine through in the alt-rock space only five years prior to the song’s release, as men would not have been socially permitted to display such emotions. Thus, when listening to this song, one should appreciate the social changes of the era that allowed Cuomo’s emotions to take the forefront of this song. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a separate note, Weezer as a band was not the typical archetype of a rock band. With their button-up shirts, dress pants, and thick-framed glasses, they look more like they are ready for a day at school than to perform a rock song in front of an audience. As written in their Pitchfork review, “[Cuomo] would become the fidgety anti-frontman with a thousand ‘revenge of the nerds’ taglines and a Harvard degree to prove it” (Mapes 2017). Despite their unconventional style, Weezer still gained massive popularity, with <em>The Blue Album</em> going “double platinum within 15 months of its release” (Mapes 2017). In fact, it is probably the case that their geeky presentation made them more relatable to their audience. Michael Hann put it well in his review of <em>The Blue Album</em>, saying “Cuomo had a fantastic ear for melody, and a goofish, nerdy uncertainty that made his misery seem universal, in a way that–for all his seismic cultural impact–[Nirvana’s lead singer Kurt] Cobain’s perhaps didn’t” (2019). It is very interesting to contrast Weezer with Nirvana, who were also very popular but fit the “rocker” look better. With their very different look, Weezer still managed to hit great levels of popularity because people could more easily relate to them and their songs. “Say It Ain’t So,” in particular, has elements that exemplify Weezer’s nerdiness. Throughout the verses, Cuomo’s voice sounds very anxious, almost afraid. It sounds like he is afraid of confrontation (until the chorus hits), which is something that many people who were, perhaps, meek as children could relate to. So, “Say It Ain’t So” holds value in its ability to stand out as a song by a group of geeks in a world of cool, rebellious rockers. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In conclusion, when listening to “Say It Ain’t So,” one should consider the context surrounding it. One should value the fact that it was taken seriously due to the increase in emotional songs sung by men. Additionally, one should appreciate that it got so popular despite Weezer being nontraditional in their appearance and presentation.</span></p><p> </p><p><a href="https://ns976-web.github.io/say-it-aint-so-project/playlist-and-listening-guide-replace-later.html">An Addict's Journey</a><a href="https://ns976-web.github.io/say-it-aint-so-project/playlist-and-listening-guide-replace-later.html"></a></p><p><a href="https://ns976-web.github.io/say-it-aint-so-project/final-essay-replace-later.html">Nerd Aesthetics and White Privilege in Indie Rock</a></p><p><a href="https://ns976-web.github.io/say-it-aint-so-project/bibliography.html">Bibliography</a></p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><nav class="footer__nav"><ul></ul></nav><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://ns976-web.github.io/say-it-aint-so-project/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://ns976-web.github.io/say-it-aint-so-project/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
